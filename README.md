## Process

Used the MySQL2 package to connect to the MYSQL database and inquirer package to perform queries and interact with the user via command line. Inorder to print MYSQL rows to the console `console.table package` is used. 

Schema contains 3 Tables - department, role and employee. Inorder to perform the SQL queries index.js has been created. And to prepopulate the database, seeds.sql is used.
